I bought a GQ Electronics GMC-300S with hopes of data logging for fun.  It has a USB-based serial connection.

The main software used for interfacing with this is called [geigerlog](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geigerlog/).

I wanted to have a Rust-based library to interface with this unit for long term data collection.
